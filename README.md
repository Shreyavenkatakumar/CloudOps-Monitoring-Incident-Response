# Cloud Operations Monitoring & Incident Response Simulation

## Project Overview
This project simulates real-world Cloud Operations (CloudOps) monitoring and incident
response tasks using an AWS EC2 instance. The focus is on observing system behavior,
analyzing logs, identifying abnormal activity, and documenting corrective actions.

## Objectives
- Observe system resource usage
- Collect and analyze logs
- Identify abnormal behavior (CPU spikes, access patterns)
- Document incidents and corrective actions
- Simulate downtime and recovery procedures

## Tools & Technologies
- AWS EC2 (Free Tier)
- Ubuntu Linux
- Linux monitoring commands (top, free, df, ps)
- Log analysis (syslog, auth.log, journalctl)
- stress-ng for incident simulation

## Key Learnings
- Importance of monitoring before troubleshooting
- Manual log analysis for incident detection
- Structured incident response workflow
- CloudOps and DevOps operational mindset
